# Crucial Crypto Maths

There's a little bit of math(s) that comes up relatively often in cryptography. 

The `Modulo operator`

Pretty much every programming language implements this operator, or has it available through a library. 

When you need to work with large numbers, use a programming language. 

`Python` is good for this as integers are unlimited in size, and you can easily get an interpreter.

When learning division for the first time, you were probably taught to use remainders in your answer. 

`X % Y` is the remainder when X is divided by Y.
