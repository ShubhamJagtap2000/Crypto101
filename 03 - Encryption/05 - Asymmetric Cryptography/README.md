# Establishing Keys Using Asymmetric Cryptography 

- A very common use of asymmetric cryptography is exchanging keys for symmetric encryption.

- Asymmetric encryption tends to be slower, so for things like HTTPS symmetric encryption is better.

- But the question is, how do you agree a key with the server without transmitting the key for people snooping to see?

## Metaphor Time

- Imagine you have a secret code, and instructions for how to use the secret code. If you want to send your friend the instructions without anyone else being able to read it, what you could do is ask your friend for a lock.

- Only they have the key for this lock, and we’ll assume you have an indestructible box that you can lock with it. 

- If you send the instructions in a locked box to your friend, they can unlock it once it reaches them and read the instructions.

- After that, you can communicate in the secret code without risk of people snooping.

- In this metaphor, the secret code represents a symmetric encryption key, the lock represents the server’s public key, and the key represents the server’s private key.

- You’ve only used asymmetric cryptography once, so it’s fast, and you can now communicate privately with symmetric encryption.

## The Real World

In reality, you need a little more cryptography to verify the person you’re talking to is who they say they are, which is done using digital signatures and certificates. You can find a lot more detail on how HTTPS (one example where you need to exchange keys) really works from this excellent [blog post](https://robertheaton.com/2014/03/27/how-does-https-actually-work/)
