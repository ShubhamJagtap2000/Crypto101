# Hashing for Integrity Checking

## Integrity Checking

Hashing can be used to `check that files haven't been changed`. 

If you put the same data in, you always get the same data out. 

If even a single bit changes, the hash will change a lot. 

This means you can use it to check that files haven't been modified or to make sure that they have downloaded correctly. 

You can also use hashing to `find duplicate files`, if two pictures have the same hash then they are the same picture.

## HMACs

HMAC is a method of using a cryptographic hashing function to verify the `authenticity` and `integrity` of data. 

The `TryHackMe VPN` uses `HMAC-SHA512` for message authentication, which you can see in the terminal output. 

A `HMAC` can be used to ensure that the person who created the HMAC is who they say they are (authenticity), and that the message hasnâ€™t been modified or corrupted (integrity). 

They use a secret key, and a hashing algorithm in order to produce a hash.
