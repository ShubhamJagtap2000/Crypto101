# Wordlists

- As we explained, in order to dictionary attack hashes, you need a list of words that you can hash and compare, unsurprisingly this is called a `wordlist`. 

- There are many different wordlists out there, a good collection to use can be found in the [SecLists](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists) repository. 
- There are a few places you can look for wordlists on your attacking system of choice, we will quickly run through where you can find them.
