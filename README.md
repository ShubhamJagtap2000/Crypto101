## An Introduction to Encryption and Learning Cryptography

Cryptography is essential in security. It is used to preserve integrity and confidentiality of sensitive information.

The internet is used by virtually everyone today for very trivial purposes such as playing games to more important tasks such as online banking. Users have started using the internet to access and utilise important services. A large part of ensuring that this communication is secure is done using Cryptographic primitives. 

This repo will explore core cryptographic topics that are used to secure communication over the internet and in machines/servers.
