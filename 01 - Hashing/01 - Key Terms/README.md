# Key Terms

**1. Plaintext -** Data before encryption or hashing, often text but not always as it could be a photograph or other file instead.

**2. Encoding -** This is NOT a form of encryption, just a form of data representation like base64 or hexadecimal. Immediately reversible.

**3. Hash:** Hash is output of a hash function. Hashing can also be used as a verb, "to hash", meaning to produce the hash value of some data.

**4. Brute force -** Attacking cryptography by trying every different password or every different key

**5. Cryptanalysis -** Attacking cryptography by finding a weakness in the underlying maths
