# Encryption Types

The two main categories of Encryption are `symmetric` and `asymmetric`.

`Symmetric` encryption uses the `same key` to encrypt and decrypt the data. 

`Examples` of Symmetric encryption are `DES (Broken)` and `AES`. 

These algorithms tend to be faster than asymmetric cryptography, and use smaller keys **(128 or 256 bit keys are common for AES, DES keys are 56 bits long)**.

`Asymmetric` encryption uses a `pair of keys`, `one to encrypt` and the `other in the pair to decrypt`. 

`Examples` are `RSA` and `Elliptic Curve` Cryptography. 

Normally these keys are referred to as a `public` key and a `private` key. 

Data encrypted with the private key can be `decrypted with the public key`, and vice versa. 

Your private key needs to be kept private, hence the name. 

`Asymmetric encryption` tends to be slower and uses larger keys, for example `RSA` typically uses `2048 to 4096 bit` keys.

RSA and Elliptic Curve cryptography are based around different mathematically difficult (intractable) problems, which give them their strength.
