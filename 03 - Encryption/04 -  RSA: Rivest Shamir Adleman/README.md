# RSA 

## Maths

- `RSA` is based on the mathematically difficult problem of working out the factors of a large number. 
- It’s very quick to multiply two prime numbers together, say 17*23 = 391, but it’s quite difficult to work out what two prime numbers multiply together to make 14351 (113x127 for reference).
